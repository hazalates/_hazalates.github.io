##### How to use the vinyl cutter

Ferah is showing me how to use the vinyl cutter. 

I want to make a label for my spicy kombucha. I found 2 very nice pepper SVG's [here](https://svgsilh.com/image/1990837.html). 

I downloaded the SVG's and put them on an USB. 

##### Opening the image with MODS

1. Turn on computer.

2. Put USB in computer.

3. Open terminal and navigate to the folder where the Mods script is located.

        cd mods

4. Type bash mods. Mods will open.

        bash mods

5. Right click programs - open program - cut to open the vinyl cutter environment.

6. Turn on vinyl cutter.

7. Select SVG file and open file.

8. Put threshold - somewhere between 0.1-0.9.

9. Edit size by changing units - the higher the unit, the smaller the size.

##### Edit image in Inkscape

To make sure the image is set up correctly we can use Inkscape.

11. Open Inkscape and open file.

To create a margin so the vinyl cutter has enough (but not too much) whitespace:

12. Go to document properties. Add 2 and press resize page (make sure you rotate if needed).

13. Lock margin.

Fill open spaces (not needed in my case):

14. Open Fill (CTRL+SHIFT+F).

15. Click on flat color.

16. Save file and open new file in Mods - After editing the image in Inkscape make sure to check all the settings in Mods (as noted above).

##### Time to start cutting

17. Pick a nice vinyl color and cut it a little bit bigger than the needed size

18. Make sure the vinyl fits between the white spaces on the cutter

!! If its a normal sticker, keep the chosen side up! If its thermal, keep desired side down !!

19. Make sure the handle on the left backside of the cutter is down

20. Place the sticker between the white spaces (from the back side, a little further than the wheels).

21. Lift up handle to lock the vinyl.

22. Select sheet: choose piece and press enter.

23. Set origin by using the left and right arrow. (not possible in my case?)

###### Last things in Mods:

24. Set speed and force - speed 2, force 50 - force depends on the thickness of the material. 

25. Make sure origin matches with the origin set on the cutter.

25. Send file to cutter

##### Errors and mistakes

!! It went completely wrong :) 

**Setting up the cutter:**

At fist i thought that the sheet setting on the vinylcutter should be set to roll. This had to be piece. Because this setting was wrong i could not move the origin on the cutter. 

**2nd problem:**

I wasn't able to resend the image to the cutter, because Mods said "waiting for file". I first had to press calculate again before i was able to resend the image.

**3rd problem:** 

I thought that i could use the side of the cutter to cut small pieces. This is not possible.
