When i arrived at Waag today two beautiful SCOBY's were waiting for me.

On the right you see a normal kombucha SCOBY, but in the lighter jar on the left sits a jun tea SCOBY. I've never worked with a jun tea SCOBY before. 

Jun tea is similiar to kombucha, but made with honey instead of sugar. Since honey is antibacterial, and a SCOBY is mostly celulose with yeast and bacteria, a normal SCOBY cannot handle honey. A jun SCOBY is resistant towards the antibacterial characteristics of honey and can ferment honey-based tea. I loosely followed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/) recipe for both jun and kombucha. 

#### Preparing first batch
##### INGREDIENTS

###### Jun:

3L water

1L starter

15g Gunpowder green tea 

320g honey 

###### Kombucha:

5L water

1L starter

25g English Melange black tea

300g raw cane sugar

##### STEPS

1. First i sterilized the jars by giving them a good rinse with soap and filling them with boiling water. When the water cooled down i emptied the jars.

1. I made the tea by boiling 1/2 the water, dissolving the sugar, adding tealeaves and letting it sit for 10 minutes. For the jun i first waited until the water cooled down to 80* before adding honey and tea.

1. After removing the tealeaves i added the other 1/2 of the water. I waited until the water cooled down to around 30*. I poured the sweetend tea into the jar. 

1. I added the SCOBY and closed the jar using paper and a rubber band.

##### Measuring

I measured the sugarcontent (brix) and sourness (PH) on several days. There is a big timegap because i had COVID. I Noticed the values stayed almost the same. 

I used a plantsoil PH meter, which problably wasn't suitable. On day 14 i used PH strips to measure, which gave better results.

X | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 10 | Day 14 | Day 16
--- | --- | ---| --- | --- | ---
**J** Brix | 7* | 7* | 7* | 7* | 6*
**J** PH | 5.5 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 3.5 | 3.5
**K** Brix | 6* | 6* | 6* | 6* | 6*
**K** PH | 5.5 | 5.4 | 5.2 | 5 | 4.5

#### Results and bottling 

On the 10th day the Jun looked really cloudy due to the yeast.

I tasted the jun on day 14 and it was already slightly too acidic. I bottled the jun in sterilized glass bottles and left them at room temperature for a second ferment. I forgot to at sugar so after two days there was no carbonation. I added suger so i hope the jun won't be to sour when enough carbonization is realized. I made new tea for the jun and refilled its jar. 

I bottled the kombucha at day 16. It is not too acidic. I made new tea using a bit more sugar (starting Brix 7*) and added vinegar to the tea to lower the PH to stimulate a thicker scoby to form. (starting PH around 4)

JB1 = Jun tea before bottling

KB1 = Kombucha before bottling

KB2 (upper) = new kombucha tea before adding vinegar

KB2 (lower) = new kombucha tea after adding vinegar
