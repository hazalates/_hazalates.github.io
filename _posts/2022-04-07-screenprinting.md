Not officially a Fablab experiment but i joined the Waag Open for a screenprint workshop. 

I've never screenprinted before, and although this was more of a screenprinting-light, i enjoyed the process.

We first got a demonstration on how to screenprint.

Then it was time to design something ourselves. 

I worked together with a really kind Spanish girl. We were both angry about the way how immigrants get treated compared to expats. We wanted to make a poster tackling this subject.

Our design consisted of the border control sign, but instead of a passport, a scale (the sign of equality) is shown. 

We added the word "Expat" above the sign, since expats are treated more highly than immigrants. 

Also there's no real difference in the meaning of the words expat and immigrant. Both imply to foreign people who move to a country to work. Immigrants mostly know they're to stay permanently, where expats stay indefinitely, thus also don't adapt to the country's culture. 

"The difference between an expat and an immigrant is in the head"
