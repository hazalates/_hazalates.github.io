I made an assessment of what projects i want to do in my remaining time at Waag.

![projects](/assets/images/2022-05-06-projects/projects01.jpg)

I ordered them by priority, the upper post-its being projects with higher priority, and de lower post-its are not urgent.

#### Main project

For my main project i want to further develop my fermentation machine. I want to add features, and make it more than just a plastic box with a homemade incubator. 

What i want to do & what do i need:

**PCB**

Learn how to make a PCB 

-> Watch Fabacademy tutorials

-> Wait for Henk/Michele to start with making a programmer

-> Learn Kicad

-> Start with small project (LED for box)

**Other heating element (& PID fine tuning)**

Look into other heating elements (start with IR -> Ask Henk (Google was unsuccesful))

Buy new element

PID control/fine tuning 

Test 

**Time control & alarm**

Make list for needed components

Write code

**Humidity measurement & control (aircirculation)**

Other chip to measure (instead of BME280) -> Ask Henk which one

Ultrasonic humidifier + basetank

**Housing/cast**

Research different materials (Mycelium? Wood?)

Sketch!

Make CAD

Prototype

**Live PH measurement**

Look into digital PH probes -> how do they work, compatible with microcontroller?

Order or build own

**App to control machine and alarms**

Dive into app design & development

Networking & communication of MC to phone/computer? Or MIM (RaspberryPi?)

**Separate box for liquids (airstone/pump)**

What do i need for fermenting liquids? -> research & make list

(Vacuum)

**Measure bad bacteria**

Prob not possible; how to set "sterile environment?" -> Make alarm for when conditions are not met?

#### Side projects

##### Making full use of Fablab

**G-Code 3D printing & 3D printing**

Dive into G-code

Ideas for 3D prints

**CNC projects**

Ideas/sketches

**Lasercut projects**

Ideas/sketches

**Vinyl projects**

Ideas/sketches

**CRISPR/CAS9 - biolumnicent bacteria - Glow in the dark yeast!**

Ask Cas for when we can do this experiment.

**Mycelium materials**

Research possible purposes

Biolab: Make mother starter. 

Make mould for growing mycelium

**Later**

Slime-mold robot

Kefirgrain plastic

##### Easy to learn but not top priority

**Sewing**

Ask Michelle to show sewing machine -> DONE

Pick up sewingmachine at dads place

Practise with old clothes

Look at pinterest for ideas for first projects (totebag?)

**Kombucha leather experiments**

Research how to make better material

Grow SCOBY

##### Could be done another time / low priority

**Molecular flavor pairing**

Watch lectures on youtube

**Hard kombucha**

Make F1

Order ale or champagne yeasts

**Wood kombucha**

Make F1

Order woodchips

**Kinect/image tracking**

Buy Kinect

Get Openkinect to work on computer

**Ableton**

Download/install

Watch tutorials
