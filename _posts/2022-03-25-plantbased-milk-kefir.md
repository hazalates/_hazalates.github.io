Even though the milk kefir grains feeds on lactose resulting in a low-to-none lactose containing end product, milk kefir is not suitable for vegans. Thats why i want to train the milk kefir grains to ferment plant-based milk. Using plant-based milk is already possible, but because the plant-based milk doesn't contain any lactose the kefir grains will starve and eventually die. 

I want to research if it's possible to slowly train the grains to eat other sources of sugar (forcing fast evolution). I'll slowly introduce soy milk (because of its high protein). 

Soy milk does contain sucrose and stachyose[^1] as the main sugar component. Because lactose breaks down into glucose and galactose (a sugar close to glucose) i'll add glucose to the soy-milk. I make the soy-milk myself, using 1L of water with 100g (dried) soybeans. 

To see how the kefir grains improve when slowly transitioning i will have 2 control groups; 100% soy-milk, and 100% milk. 

Each day i'll make a new batch, and examine the kefir grains based on their looks and reproduction/weight.

The schedule for training the grains is as follows:

Day | % Soy | % Milk
--- | --- | ---
Day 1 | 10 % | 90%
Day 2 | 20 % | 80%
Day 3 | 30 % | 70%
Day 4 | 40 % | 60%
Day 5 | 50 % | 50%
Day 6 | 60 % | 40%
Day 7 | 70 % | 30%
Day 8 | 80 % | 20%
Day 9 | 90 % | 10%


The results of the examination

Weight | Milk | Soy & Milk | Soy
--- | --- | --- | ---
Start | 20g | 20g | 20g |
Batch 1 | 22g | 26g | 27g |
Batch 2 | 25g | 25g | 22g |
Batch 3 | 27g | 33g | 23g |
Batch 4 | g | g | g |

Looks | Milk | Soy & Milk | Soy
--- | --- | --- | ---
Batch 1 | Buttermilk-like structure | Milk separated, yoghurt-like texture, slightly fizzy | Milk separated a lot, fizzy taste  |
Batch 2 |  | Milk separated, yoghurt-like texture, slightly fizzy | Milk almost completely separated, strong fizzy taste |
Batch 3 | Buttermilk-like structure | Strongly fermented and fizzy, jar almost exploding | Very liquid, slightly fermented smell and taste |
Batch 4 | g | g | g |
