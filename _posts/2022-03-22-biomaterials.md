The bio-hack academy is focussing on bio-materials and living organisms this week. Since i have a big obsession with food and fermentation this sounded like a really interesting class to join. 

#### Mycelium material-bank

We started with making a material-bank for mycelium. 

First we needed food for the mycelium. This consists of the following ingredients:

- Peptone (containing animal protein, but a vegan peptone is available)

- Agar

- Malt

- Water

This mixture is placed in a glass bottle in a pressure-cooker to sterilize. 

Next we poured the mixture in a petri-dish. It is very important to work VERY sterile. We disinfected the table and our gloves and used a gas burner to keep the air around clean.

We waited to the mixture to solidify, forming a gel-like substance. 

When the mixture was solid, we scraped a bit of mycelium of a mother-bank and impregnated our petri.

We sealed the petri and placed it in an incubator. After two weeks we should have enough mycelium to work with. 

Instead of using the normal mycelium mother i used tempeh starter (Rhizopus Oligosporis and Rhizopus Oryzae).

#### Using SCOBY culture as biomaterial

Next we watched a lecture about using a SCOBY as biomaterial. We saw multiple applications, which gave me a lot in inspiration. 

I didn't follow along with the SCOBY making since i have an overflow of SCOBY's because of my fermentation project. 

Some projects i'd like to do with SCOBY:

- A cover for my notebook out of SCOBY leather.

- A phone cover.

- Using SCOBY as a conductor to incorporate into my electronic designs (RESEARCH -> conducting properties of cellulose).
