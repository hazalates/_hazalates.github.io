Even though the milk kefir grains feeds on lactose resulting in a low-to-none lactose containing end product, milk kefir is not suitable for vegans. Thats why i want to train the milk kefir grains to ferment plant-based milk. This is already possible, but because the plant-based milk doesn't contain any lactose the kefir grains will starve and eventually die. 

I want to research if it's possible to slowly train the grains to eat other sources of sugar (forcing fast evolution). I'll slowly introduce soy milk (because of its high protein). 

Soy milk does contain sucrose and stachyose[^1] as the main sugar component. Because lactose breaks down into glucose and galactose (a sugar close to glucose) i'll add glucose to the soy-milk.
