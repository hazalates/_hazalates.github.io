The kefir grains are now fully transitioned to soy-milk with 1% glucose added. 

To see if the grains are vital now they won't get any lactose anymore i set up a new experiment. 

1. Transitioned grains in soy-milk with 1% glucose added

2. Milk-kefir grains in soy-milk

3. Milk-kefir grains in milk

My prognosis is that #2 will stop growing after a few batches. #3 will remain a steady quality. #1 will hopefully stay vital, but will at least survive longer than #2.

Also; i really didn't like the taste of the soy kefir. So i made another batch:

4. Transitioned grains in oat-milk with 1% glucose
