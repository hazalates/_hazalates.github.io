<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open VCarf pro.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new file.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Job size (X &amp; Y): Measure the width and height of the material.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can either use the correct full-size width/height of the material, or trick the machine in thinking the material is smaller than its original size.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Material (Z): Set Zero at the bottom. Except when using foam/wax/3D milling: When you don’t want to cut all the way through the material.</li>
</ol>

<p>Measure the thickness of the material. Use a caliper.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>XY Datum position: ! Important, always double check ! Set the orientation point. Use the bottom-left corner (See blue dot on the picture).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Units: Use mm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modeling resolution: Not important, is used for rendering.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When finished, press “OK”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Always keep the orientation of the CNC in mind. X-axis should be the side parallel to the wall, Y-axis should be the “open” side. XY datum position should be the bottom left corner. When sitting behind the CNC-computer, line up the computer to correspondent with the right orientation.</p>

<h5 id="types-of-mills">Types of mills</h5>

<p>When choosing a mill there are a few things to consider.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Diameter: Thickness of the mill. The thicker the mill, the faster and less precise. The thinner, the slower but more precise. Standard is 5mm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flutes: The number of threads of the mill. The more flutes, the more precise the milling, but also more slow.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One flute: For rough/prototype work. Fast, but not very neat.</p>

<p>Two flutes: Standard, more precise.</p>

<p>Four flutes: For very precise work. Slower.</p>

<p>The flutes are important for the speed of the machine, because the mill needs to drain the material. The more flutes, the more difficult to drain the material.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tips: We mostly work with two kind of tips; End mill (flat) or Ball nose mill (rounded). We generally use the square end mills. Ball nose mills are used for milling contoured surfaces.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="toolpaths">Toolpaths</h5>

<p>Open the toolpath menu</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca7.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca8.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<p>We create different toolpaths for the milling.</p>

<p>The order of the toolpaths should be as following:</p>

<p>1 - drilling toolpath</p>

<p>2 - pockets toolpath</p>

<p>3 - inner cutting toolpath</p>

<p>4 - outer cutting toolpath</p>

<p><strong>1 - Drilling toolpath</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca9.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<p>Use this toolpath to make holes for your screws to hold down the material when milling. Use the same size for the holes as for the mill. (If mill size is 5mm -&gt; drilling hole size should also be 5mm)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select the drilling holes. (When using Vector selection order the machine will mill the holes in the order of selecting)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set start depth and cut depth</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Start depth - If starting on the top of the material (most cases) start depth is 0. (Except for when drilling in a pocket)</p>

<p>Cut depth - You don’t want to cut all the way through because you want the screw to hold onto something. (2/3 of the material thickness is good)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the tool (mill)</li>
</ol>

<p>When pressing select the tool database will open. Select the desired tool and settings.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca10.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<p><strong>Tool info</strong></p>

<p>Name - Name of the tool</p>

<p>Tool type - select End mill or Ball nose. (or other type you’re working with)</p>

<p><strong>Geometry</strong></p>

<p>Diameter - Diameter of the mill using.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting Parameters</strong></p>

<p>Pass Depth - Depth for every vector per pass (you always use multiple passes) (half of the diameter of the mill). If using a 5mm mill pass depth is 2.5.</p>

<p>Step over - Distance between each pass of the machine tool head. The larger the step over, the faster the job but the less precise. 100% step over is no overlap. 50% is half overlap. The lower the step over, the smoother the surface.</p>

<p>Larger stepover: rough milling, fast prototypes.</p>

<p>Small stepover: nicer material, nice finish, precise work.</p>

<p><strong>Feeds and Speeds</strong></p>

<p>30% is roughly in the middle - Good startpoint</p>

<p>Spindle speed - 1800 for wood (maximum speed).</p>

<p>Feed rate - 50 - 60 mm for wood with 2 flute end mill. Smaller diameter -&gt; Go slower. Check with Henk and other presets (trial and error) more flute; go slower (not completely sure).</p>

<p>Plunge rate - Speed of going down, always on 20. If milling foam (easier for mill) 100 - 120 mm per second.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Peck drilling - Doing down in steps. (don’t need to use) (look up when to use)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dwell at the bottom of each drill pass - no clue, need to look up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press calculate and then close.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2 - Pocket toolpath</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca11.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set start depth and cutting depth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select tool</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clear Pocket:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Offset (square spiral - not beneficial for circle) or raster (side by side).</p>

<p>Cut direction - Climb or conventional. (doesn’t matter)</p>

<p>Raster angle - Set raster angle to match only moving the head of the machine.</p>

<p>Profile pass - Nice to do at the end to avoid ugly bits.</p>

<p>Pocket allowance - How tightly the mill moves. (To make thing fit loosely or tightly)</p>

<p><strong>3 - Profile toolpath</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-22-cnc/cnca12.jpg" alt="cnc" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set start depth and cutting depth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select tool</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Machine vectors - Where to place mill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seperate last pass - makes cut smoother.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tabs !! Important !! - Little nudges to connect everything to abound pieces moving during milling and being sucked up by ventilation.
Preferably no tabs on corners.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After creating toolpaths</strong></p>

<p>Save the file and name the toolpaths. Make sure the drilling toolpath is separate from the other toolpaths.</p>

<p>Clock icon - Check how long milling takes</p>

<p>Floppy icon - Save toolpaths
Save files separately. Set metric system. Save file in map.</p>

<p><strong>!! Safety break - Check your file !!</strong></p>

<p>When changing a file - Always calculate again! Never change anything after checking. Breathe, don’t hurry.</p>

<p>Make sure the drilling toolpath is separate from the other toolpaths.</p>

<p>Triple check your settings. Watch 3D view.</p>

<p><strong>!! Safety break - Before using the machine !!</strong></p>

<p>Always tie your hair.</p>

<p>Put on safety goggles.</p>

<p>Optional: Use ear protection on longer sittings.</p>

<p>Make sure there are no obstructions near the machine (no pieces of wood leaning onto the machine).</p>
