I"Ö<p>When i arrived at Waag today two beautiful SCOBYâ€™s were waiting for me.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-07-kombucha/Kombucha01.jpg" alt="Kombucha01" /></p>

<p>On the right you see a normal kombucha SCOBY, but in the lighter jar on the left sits a jun tea SCOBY. Iâ€™ve never worked with a jun tea SCOBY before.</p>

<p>Jun tea is similar to kombucha, but made with honey instead of sugar. Since honey is antibacterial, and a SCOBY is mostly cellulose with yeast and bacteria, a normal SCOBY cannot handle honey. A jun SCOBY is resistant towards the antibacterial characteristics of honey and can ferment honey-based tea. I loosely followed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/">this</a> recipe for both jun and kombucha.</p>

<h4 id="preparing-first-batch">Preparing first batch</h4>
<h5 id="ingredients">INGREDIENTS</h5>

<h6 id="jun">Jun:</h6>

<p>3L water</p>

<p>1L starter</p>

<p>15g Gunpowder green tea</p>

<p>320g honey</p>

<h6 id="kombucha">Kombucha:</h6>

<p>5L water</p>

<p>1L starter</p>

<p>25g English Melange black tea</p>

<p>300g raw cane sugar</p>

<h5 id="steps">STEPS</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First i sterilized the jars by giving them a good rinse with soap and filling them with boiling water. When the water cooled down i emptied the jars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the tea by boiling 1/2 the water, dissolving the sugar, adding tealeaves and letting it sit for 10 minutes. For the jun i first waited until the water cooled down to 80* before adding honey and tea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After removing the tealeaves i added the other 1/2 of the water. I waited until the water cooled down to around 30*. I poured the sweetened tea into the jar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I added the SCOBY and closed the jar using paper and a rubber band.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="measuring">Measuring</h5>

<p>I measured the sugar content (Brix) and sourness (PH) on several days. There is a big time-gap because i had COVID. I Noticed the values stayed almost the same.</p>

<p>I used a plant-soil PH meter, which probably wasnâ€™t suitable. On day 14 i used PH strips to measure, which gave better results.</p>

<h4 id="results-and-bottling">Results and bottling</h4>

<p>On the 10th day the Jun looked really cloudy due to the yeast.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-07-kombucha/Kombucha03.jpg" alt="Kombucha03" /></p>

<p>I tasted the jun on day 14 and it was already slightly too acidic. I bottled the jun in sterilized glass bottles and left them at room temperature for a second ferment. I forgot to at sugar so after two days there was no carbonation. I added sugar so i hope the jun wonâ€™t be to sour when enough carbonization is realized. I made new tea for the jun and refilled its jar.</p>

<p>I bottled the kombucha at day 16. It is not too acidic. I made new tea using a bit more sugar (starting Brix 7*) and added vinegar to the tea to lower the PH to stimulate a thicker scoby to form. (starting PH around 4)</p>
