I"Û<p>Slime molds are single cell organisms which you can see with the naked eye. Although not having a brain, they have what is known as the most primitive form of intelligence and memory, being able to solve mazes and control robots.</p>

<p>I want to make a robot controlled by the slime mold, but in order to do so iâ€™ll first study their behavior.</p>

<h4 id="experiment-1-ir-light">Experiment 1: (IR-)light</h4>

<p>Knowing they donâ€™t like visible light, how do slime molds react to infrared?</p>

<p>To test this i made a simple circuit, connecting a IR-LED to a 9v battery.</p>

<p>First i calculated the resistance needed to connect an IR-LED to a 9v battery.</p>

<p>Then i soldered the circuit.</p>

<p>To see if the mold preferred darkness over IR, we taped part of the petri-dish containing the molds. We used two petri-dishes with molds to lower the chance of a random/false result.</p>

<p>Together with the IR we put the molds in a box to check on them in a couple of days.</p>

<h6 id="results">Results</h6>

<p>The result wasnâ€™t the result i expected! I expected the molds disliking the IR light, or not responding to it at all.</p>

<p>Instead one of the slime molds completely moved to the side with IR. The other mold didnâ€™t respond to it at all.</p>

<p>(left: mold didnâ€™t respond, right: mold moved to IR side completely)</p>

<p>This could have multiple reasons. The left petri-dish only has a single layer of tape, maybe the IR light past trough the tape. Also, the white tape + the plastic of the petri-dish could reflect the IR, so the tape didnâ€™t prevent the IR coming in.</p>

<p>To do: Same experiment, but with black tape to avoid reflection. Maybe a smaller area with IR to see if they are really attracted to IR.</p>
