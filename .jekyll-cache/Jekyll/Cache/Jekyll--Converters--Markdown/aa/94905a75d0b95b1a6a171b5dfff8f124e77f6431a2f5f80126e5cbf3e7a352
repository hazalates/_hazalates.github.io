I"§<p>Even though the milk kefir grains feeds on lactose resulting in a low-to-none lactose containing end product, milk kefir is not suitable for vegans. Thats why i want to train the milk kefir grains to ferment plant-based milk. Using plant-based milk is already possible, but because the plant-based milk doesnâ€™t contain any lactose the kefir grains will starve and eventually die.</p>

<p>I want to research if itâ€™s possible to slowly train the grains to eat other sources of sugar (forcing fast evolution). Iâ€™ll slowly introduce soy milk (because of its high protein).</p>

<p>Soy milk does contain sucrose and stachyose[^1] as the main sugar component. Because lactose breaks down into glucose and galactose (a sugar close to glucose) iâ€™ll add glucose to the soy-milk. I make the soy-milk myself, using 1L of water with 100g (dried) soybeans.</p>

<p>To see how the kefir grains improve when slowly transitioning i will have 2 control groups; 100% soy-milk, and 100% milk.</p>

<p>Each day iâ€™ll make a new batch, and examine the kefir grains based on their looks and reproduction/weight.</p>

<p>The schedule for training the grains is as follows:</p>

<p>Looks of the first batch (after 24h of fermenting):</p>

<p>*Used other kind of soy milk (AH huismerk sojadrink)
** Shorter fermentation time (18h)
<strong>* Didnâ€™t take care of the kefir in the weekend, fermentation time for batch 8 is 62h 
**</strong> To get a good result of how much the grains have grown i rinsed them with water to remove all the milk. The weight is lower compared to te results where i didnâ€™t wash the grains</p>

<p>31-03: I noticed the grains in 100% soy donâ€™t reproduce and their effectiveness starts to decline. The grains in 100% milk have a steady consistency, but the mix-grains ferment crazy fast. Yeast and bacteria work more effective when submitted to manageable amounts of stress, but i also hope they react well to the glucose added. The soy-kefir has a very strong soy taste which is displeasing. Hopefully i can successfully make oatmilk-kefir in the future, which probably doesnâ€™t have a strong by-taste.</p>

<p>I switched to store bought soy milk since it wasnâ€™t doable to make soy-milk each morning, and the grains seem to react better on the store bought milk, probably due the higher sugar content.</p>

<p>07-04: The soy/milk grains are now completely converted to soymilk. Of all the batches, theyâ€™ve reproduces the most, going from 20g to 42g (where the milkgrains reached 35g and te soygrains shrunk to 17g). I hope the grains stay vital and donâ€™t need lactose anymore. Further tests will get their own page ;)</p>
