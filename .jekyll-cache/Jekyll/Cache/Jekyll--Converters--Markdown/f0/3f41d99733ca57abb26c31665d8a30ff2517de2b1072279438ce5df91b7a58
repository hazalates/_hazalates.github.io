I"¼<p>The bio-hack academy is focussing on biomaterials and living organisms this week. Since i have a big obsession with food and fermentation this sounded like a really interesting class to join.</p>

<h4 id="mycelium-material-bank">Mycelium material-bank</h4>

<p>We started with making a material-bank for mycelium.</p>

<p>First we needed food for the mycelium. This consists of the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Peptone (containing animal protein, but a vegan peptone is available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This mixture is placed in a glass bottle in a pressurecooker to sterilize.</p>

<p>Next we poured the mixture in a petridish. It is very important to work VERY sterile. We desinfected the table and our gloves and used a gass burner to keep the air around clean.</p>

<p>We waited to the mixture to solidify, forming a gell-like substance.</p>

<p>When the mixure was solid, we scraped a bit of mycelium of a mother-bank and impregnated our petri.</p>

<p>We sealed the petri and placed it in an incubator. After two weeks we should have enough mycelium to work with.</p>

<p>Instead of using the normal mycelium mother i used tempeh starter (Rhizopus Oligosporis and Rhizopus Oryzae).</p>

<h4 id="using-scoby-culture-as-biomaterial">Using SCOBY culture as biomaterial</h4>

<p>Next we watched a lecture about using a SCOBY as biomaterial. We saw multiple applications, which gave me a lot in inspiration.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t follow along with the SCOBY making since i have an overflow of SCOBYâ€™s because of my fermentation project.</p>

<p>Some projects iâ€™d like to do with SCOBY:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A cover for my notebook out of SCOBY leather.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A phone cover.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using SCOBY as a conductor to incorporate into my electronic designs (RESEARCH -&gt; conducting proporties of cellulose).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
