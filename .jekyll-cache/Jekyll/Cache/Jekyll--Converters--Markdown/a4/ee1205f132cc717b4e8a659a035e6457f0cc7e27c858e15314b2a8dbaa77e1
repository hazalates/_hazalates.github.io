I"Ö<p>To be able to live measure PH iâ€™ll try to hook up a PH probe to my arduino.</p>

<h4 id="possible-obstacles">Possible obstacles</h4>

<p>There are a few possible problems to be aware of:
PH Probes need calibration. How often? Can it live measure during one round of fermentation and then calibration?</p>

<p>Does the material of the probe influence the ferment (fermentation + reactive metals donâ€™t go well together)</p>

<p>I started by following <a href="https://cdn.awsli.com.br/969/969921/arquivos/ph-sensor-ph-4502c.pdf">this</a> tutorial about setting up the PH probe.</p>

<p>My pinout is as follow:</p>

<p>V+ - Arduino 5V
PO â€“ Arduino A0
Gnd â€“ Arduino Gnd</p>

<p>(Plaatje Arduino)</p>

<p>I short-circuit the BNC connector to stimulate a neutral PH7.</p>

<p>(plaatje BNC)</p>

<p>Then i used the following code and screw the POT until i got a value of 2,50v (2,51/2,51 in my case)</p>

<p>(plaatje code)</p>

<p>Now the resistance/input signal is calibrated.</p>

<p>######</p>

<p>Next i hooked up the PH probe and let it sit in distilled water (PH7)</p>

<p>(plaatje probe)</p>

<p>I used the following code to read the measured PH value</p>

<p>(plaatje code)</p>

<p>After waiting for a couple of minutes to stabilize it gave me a reading of 8,75.</p>

<p>I checked with the digital PH meter which gave me a reading of 7,02.</p>
