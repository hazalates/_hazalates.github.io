<p>No, probably not. But i possibly could make my eyes glow-in-the-dark. Although that might not be a good idea.</p>

<p>Intro into gene editing with CRISPR-CAS9</p>

<p>Marta de Menezes is a bio-artist who workes with CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing. Inspired by her lecture today at the Bio-Hack Academy, i want to learn more about CRISPR-CAS9, its possibilities, and learn how to use it.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-crispr-cas9">What is CRISPR-CAS9?</h4>

<p>CRISPR-CAS9 is a method used for gene editing which allows us to relatively easy alter characteristics in living organisms. This method is originally found in bacteria to protect them from enemy DNA injected by bacteriophages.</p>

<h4 id="part-1-synthesis-of-sgrna">Part 1: Synthesis of sgRNA</h4>

<p>First we synthesized the sgRNA:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr2.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p>We prepared the Diluted Ribonuclease Inhibitor on day one.</p>

<p>Because something went wrong during purification i performed the experiment twice. For the second experiment i didnâ€™t executed part one, but got the sgRNA (unpurified) from another group.</p>

<h5 id="experiment-1-sghl3--sghl4">Experiment 1: sgHL3 &amp; sgHL4</h5>

<p>On day two we performed the other steps in part 1 of the protocol. I added both the sgHL3 and sgHL4. The total volume of my synthesized sgRNA (before purifying) is 55 microL.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr3.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<h5 id="experiment-2-sghl3">Experiment 2: sgHL3</h5>

<p>The sgRNA for experiment two was made following all the steps from the protocol part 1, using sgHL3</p>

<h4 id="part-2-purification-of-sgrna">Part 2: Purification of sgRNA</h4>

<h5 id="experiment-1-monarch-kit">Experiment 1: Monarch kit</h5>

<p>Instead of following the protocol, we used the monarch kit and itâ€™s description.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr11.jpg" alt="crispr" /> 
<img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr10.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p>Because the initial sample i made was 55 microL i changed the measurements used in the Monarch protocol:</p>

<p>Step 1: 110 microL RNA cleanup binding buffer</p>

<p>Step 2: 165 microL ethanol</p>

<p>Step 3: As stated in protocol</p>

<p>Step 4: As stated in protocol.</p>

<p>Step 5: As stated in protocol.</p>

<p><strong>!! Then i discovered a mistake !!</strong></p>

<p>The RNA cleanup wash buffer should have been diluted with ethanol as stated on the front of the Monarch protocol.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr9.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p>I missed this step. My RNA cleanup wash buffer is 4x as strong as needed. This problaby made the cleaning too strong or too weak. Because i didnâ€™t wanted to discard the project i continued.</p>

<p>Step 6: As stated in protocol.</p>

<p>Step 7: 20 microL Nuclease-free H20 (Kit T2040)</p>

<p>I stored the mixture in ice until ready for part 3.</p>

<h5 id="experiment-2-zymo-research-kit">Experiment 2: Zymo Research kit</h5>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr8.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr6.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr7.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p>I started with 50 microL unpurified RNA to which i added 150 microL RNA cleanup binding buffer (from the previous used Monarch kit) instead of TRI Reagent.</p>

<p>I followed the RNA cleanup protocol as shown above.</p>

<h4 id="part-3-in-vitro-cleavage-of-dna-using-crisprcas9">Part 3: In vitro cleavage of DNA using CRISPR/Cas9</h4>

<p>I executed the same process in part 3 for both the samples i made.</p>

<p>I followed the protocol i started with:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-11-crispr/crispr5.jpg" alt="crispr" /></p>

<p>After adding the Proteinase K and incubating the samples i stored them in the freezer for later evaluation.</p>
