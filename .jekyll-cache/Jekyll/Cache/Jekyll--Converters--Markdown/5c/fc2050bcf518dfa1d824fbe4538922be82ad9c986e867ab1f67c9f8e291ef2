I"º<p>Slime molds are single cell organisms which you can see with the naked eye. Although not having a brain, they have what is known as the most primitive form of intelligence and memory, being able to solve mazes and control robots.</p>

<p>I want to make a robot controlled by the slime mold, but in order to do so iâ€™ll first study their behavior.</p>

<p>Knowing they donâ€™t like visible light, how do slime molds react to infrared?</p>
