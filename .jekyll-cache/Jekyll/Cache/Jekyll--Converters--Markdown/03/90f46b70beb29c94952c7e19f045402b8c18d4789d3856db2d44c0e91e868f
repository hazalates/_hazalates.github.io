I"­<p>Today i tagged along with the bio-hack academy to do some experiments with a color producing bacteria.</p>

<p>The Janthinobacterium lividum is a dark blue bacteria. The pigment produces by this bacteria can be used to color textile.</p>

<p>To try this i first needed some material to dye, so i went to the Zeeman and bought some socks, underpants, and a shirt.</p>

<p>To make sort of a pattern i looked up different Shogun techniques and used rubber bands to tye the textile.</p>
