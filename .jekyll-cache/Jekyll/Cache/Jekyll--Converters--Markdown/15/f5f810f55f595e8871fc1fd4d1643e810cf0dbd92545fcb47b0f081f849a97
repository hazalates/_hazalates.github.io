I"Î<p>This week is the fourth week since starting my internship at Waag. So far i really like everything i do and the overload of extremely interesting things to learn. Preferably i want to learn everything, fablab/bio-hack/fabrilab combined but sadly i donâ€™t have enough time so i have to narrow my subjects.</p>

<h6 id="subjects">Subjects</h6>

<p>I do want to focus on food (foodtech/science, but also engineering things for food). It doesnâ€™t have to be really strict but i think it will be good to work within a theme.</p>

<h6 id="ferments">Ferments</h6>

<p>I spent a lot of time taking care of the ferments. I do want do keep fermenting but i donâ€™t want it to consume all my time. Although i donâ€™t think it needs to, now everything has been set up. I can make a schedule for what needs to be done on a dayly/weekly basis.</p>

<h6 id="sprints">Sprints</h6>

<p>To optimize my workflow and to stay focussed i want to work with sprints. I want to pick one topic per week to focus on. I want to try to minimize the time i spend on documenting and do this in my own time.</p>

<h6 id="reflection">Reflection</h6>

<p>I also want to write a small reflection at the end of each week to see if i completed my goals and to check if i can improve anything.</p>

<h6 id="flexible-attitude">Flexible attitude</h6>

<p>Last but not least i do want to stay flexible and allow myself to also focus on unexpected interesting subjects.</p>

<h5 id="to-do-to-incorporate-this">TO DO to incorporate this:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make rough weekschedule (lectures, documentation, ferments, weekreflection)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
