I"±<p>To post images in my blogposts for my documentation website i have to convert the images to an usable image extension. When importing photoâ€™s i took with my phone (Iphone 11), the original extension is *.HEIC. An usable extention would be jpeg. Ideally, i want the images to have a small file size.</p>

<p>I could convert the images using Adobe Lightroom, but this would be a rather dramatic program/workflow for such a simple task. I can do better than this. I watched the lecture about Computer-aided Design, and came across Imagemagick. Imagemagick is a lightweight command line-based software for processing images.</p>

<p>To install Imagemagick i opend terminal and ran the following commands. Note: I already have Homebrew installed from installing Jekyll and Ruby</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install imagemagick
brew install ghostscript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/imagemagick">this</a> tutorial i tried the display command.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/waag/site/thinkspace/assets/images/2022-03-07-kombucha
display *.HEIC
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should give me the only GUI of Imagemagick, instead i got an error message.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>display: delegate library support not built-in '' (X11) @ error/display.c/DisplayImageCommand/1898.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I googled the issue and a lot of steps need to be taken to resolve this issue. Because i want save time using Imagemagick instead of spending more time setting up Imagemagick i googled for another solution.</p>

<p>Apparently since macOS Montereyâ€Œ my mac has a build-in function for converting images.</p>
