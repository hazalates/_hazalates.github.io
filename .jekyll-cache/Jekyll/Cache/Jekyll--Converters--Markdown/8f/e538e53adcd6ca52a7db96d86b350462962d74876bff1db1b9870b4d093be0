I"Ù<p>The kefir grains are now fully transitioned to soy-milk with 1% glucose added.</p>

<p>To see if the grains are vital now they wonâ€™t get any lactose anymore i set up a new experiment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Transitioned grains in soy-milk with 1% glucose added</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Milk-kefir grains in soy-milk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Milk-kefir grains in milk</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My prognosis is that #2 will stop growing after a few batches. #3 will remain a steady quality. #1 will hopefully stay vital, but will at least survive longer than #2.</p>

<p>Also; i really didnâ€™t like the taste of the soy kefir. So i made another batch:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Transitioned grains in oatmilk with 1% glucose</li>
</ol>
