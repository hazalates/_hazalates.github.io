I"£<p>Today i started working on the kefir grains. Henk brought both water and milk kefir grains. My goal is to make vegan milk kefir (and maybe even kefir yoghurt and kefir cheese).</p>

<p>Milk kefir feeds on lactose and although it is posible to make a few batches of plant-based milk kefir, the kefirgrains needs lactose after 3-6 rounds of plant-based kefir.</p>

<p>I would like to research if its possible to â€œtrainâ€ the milk kefir grains to feed on other sugar sources than lactose and to be stable over time.</p>

<p>Before i start with this process i want the grains to be in optimal conditions and to reproduce. Therefor iâ€™ll make a few rounds of cowmilk kefir.</p>

<p>So as the bad vegan i am i went to the supermarket and bought my first package of milk in years ;)</p>

<p>I started on straining the grains using a nutmilk bag and a colander. Then i weighed the grains and added them to 500ml of biological pasteurized milk.</p>
