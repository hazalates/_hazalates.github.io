I"Å<p>To post images in my blog-posts for my documentation website i have to convert the images to an usable image extension. When importing photo‚Äôs i took with my phone (Iphone 11), the original extension is *.HEIC. An usable extension would be jpeg. Ideally, i want the images to have a small file size.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-21-imagemagick/Screenshot-01.png" alt="Screenshot-01" /></p>

<p>I could convert the images using Adobe Lightroom, but this would be a rather dramatic program/workflow for such a simple task. I can do better than this. I watched the lecture about Computer-aided Design, and came across Imagemagick. Imagemagick is a lightweight command line-based software for processing images.</p>

<p>To install Imagemagick i launched terminal and ran the following commands. Note: I already have Homebrew installed from installing Jekyll and Ruby</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install imagemagick
brew install ghostscript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/imagemagick">this</a> tutorial i tried the display command.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/waag/site/hazalates.github.io/assets/images/2022-03-07-kombucha
display *.HEIC
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should give me the only GUI of Imagemagick, instead i got an error message.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>display: delegate library support not built-in '' (X11) @ error/display.c/DisplayImageCommand/1898.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I googled the issue and a lot of steps need to be taken to resolve this issue. Because i want save time using Imagemagick instead of spending more time setting up Imagemagick i googled for another solution.</p>

<p>Apparently since macOS Monterey‚Äå my mac has a build-in function for converting images.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-21-imagemagick/Screenshot-02.png" alt="Screenshot-02" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-21-imagemagick/Screenshot-03.png" alt="Screenshot-03" /></p>

<p>Still wanting to give Imagemagick another shot i decided to not use the GUI, but use a command instead.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mogrify -format jpg *.HEIC
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I compared the file sized of the files converted by Mac and Imagemagick.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-21-imagemagick/Screenshot-04.png" alt="Screenshot-04" /></p>

<p>TO DO: Trying different file size compressions with Imagemagick, since the file sized are still very big. I do want to use Imagemagick since i have more control over the outcome.</p>

<p>Ps. 
    n=1; for file in *; do mv ‚Äú$file‚Äù ‚ÄúPicture $n‚Äù; let n++; done</p>

<p>Using this command i can change the filenames of the images all at once.</p>
