I"€<p>Iâ€™ve been brewing a lot of kefir and kombucha at Waag lately, and although i really like the process for making beverages, i want to experiment with possible other applications for the SCOBY and kefir grains that grow exponential. I joined the lecture of the bio-hack academy about living organisms and there i saw a lot of interesting examples of what is possible with a SCOBY, and i began to wonder if something similar is possible with kefir grains, since they also produce a lot of new grains each batch. The lecture also introduced me into how to work with mycelium. I am very interested in molds, and mycelium seems like a interesting product to work with.</p>

<p>Here are some projects iâ€™ve came across that inspires me and possible projects i want to develop.</p>

<h5 id="mycelium">Mycelium</h5>

<h6 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h6>

<h6 id="possible-projects">Possible projects</h6>

<p>Using the mycelium in a moulding and casting assignment.</p>

<p>Using the mycelium to make a case for my fermentation machine.</p>

<h5 id="scoby">SCOBY</h5>

<h6 id="inspiration-1">Inspiration</h6>

<h6 id="possible-projects-1">Possible projects</h6>

<p>Research the electrical properties of SCOBY (cellulose) and way to incorporate SCOBY into a engineering projects (using it as a conductor/using it to make a keyboard of other input device.)</p>

<p>Make SCOBY leather, use it to make a bag/phonecase etc.</p>

<h5 id="kefir-grains">Kefir grains</h5>

<h6 id="inspiration-2">Inspiration</h6>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014305719313825">This</a> research shows a possible way of using kefir-grains to make bio-plastic</p>

<h6 id="possible-project">Possible project</h6>

<p>Reseach if i can recreate the process of using kefir-grains to make bio-plastic. Also investigate multiple possibilities, such as laser-cutting the material and looking at decomposing time</p>

<h5 id="bio-luminescent-yeast">Bio-luminescent yeast</h5>

<h6 id="inspiration-3">Inspiration</h6>

<p>Crispr-Cas/gene editing (biolab)</p>

<h6 id="possible-project-1">Possible project</h6>

<p>Brew something (kombucha/cider/beer) glow in the dark.</p>
