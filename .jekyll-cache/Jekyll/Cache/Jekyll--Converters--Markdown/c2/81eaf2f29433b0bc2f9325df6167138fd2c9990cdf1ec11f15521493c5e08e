I"p<p>Not officially a Fablab experiment but i joined the Waag Open for a screenprint workshop.</p>

<p>I’ve never screenprinted before, and although this was more of a screenprinting-light, i enjoyed the process.</p>

<p>We first got a demonstration on how to screenprint.</p>

<p>Then it was time to design something ourselves.</p>

<p>I worked together with a really kind Spanish girl. We were both angry about the way how immigrants get treated compared to expats. We wanted to make a poster tackling this subject.</p>

<p>Our design consisted of the border control sign, but instead of a passport, a scale (the sign of equality) is shown.</p>

<p>We added the word “Expat” above the sign, since expats are treated more highly than immigrants.</p>

<p>Also there’s no real difference in the meaning of the words expat and immigrant. Both imply to foreign people who move to a country to work. Immigrants mostly know they’re to stay permanently, where expats stay indefinitely, thus also don’t adapt to the country’s culture.</p>

<p>“The difference between an expat and an immigrant is in the head”</p>
