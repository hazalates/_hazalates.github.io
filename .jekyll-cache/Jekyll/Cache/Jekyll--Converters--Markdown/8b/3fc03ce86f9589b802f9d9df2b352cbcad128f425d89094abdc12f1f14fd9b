I"ß<p>To post images in my blogposts for my documentation website i have to convert the images to an usable image extension. When importing photoâ€™s i took with my phone (Iphone 11), the original extension is *.HEIC. An usable extention would be jpeg. Ideally, i want the images to have a small file size.</p>

<p>I could convert the images using Adobe Lightroom, but this would be a rather dramatic program/workflow for such a simple task. I can do better than this. I watched the lecture about Computer-aided Design, and came across Imagemagick. Imagemagick is a lightweight command line-based software for processing images.</p>

<p>To install Imagemagick i opend terminal and ran the following commands. Note: I already have Homebrew installed from installing Jekyll and Ruby</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install imagemagick
brew install ghostscript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/imagemagick">this</a> tutorial i tried the display command.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/waag/site/thinkspace/assets/images/2022-03-07-kombucha
display *.HEIC
</code></pre></div></div>
