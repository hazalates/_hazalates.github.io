<p>Intro into gene editing with CRISPR-CAS9</p>

<p>Marta de Menezes is a bio-artist who workes with CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing. Inspired by her lecture today at the Bio-Hack Academy, i want to learn more about CRISPR-CAS9, its possibilities, and learn how to use it.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-crispr-cas9">What is CRISPR-CAS9?</h4>

<p>CRISPR-CAS9 is a method used for gene editing which allows us to relatively easy alter characteristics in living organisms. This method is originally found in bacteria to protect them from enemy DNA injected by bacteriophages.</p>
