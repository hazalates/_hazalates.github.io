I"ì<p>Today i tagged along with the bio-hack academy to do some experiments with a color producing bacteria.</p>

<p>The Janthinobacterium lividum is a dark blue bacteria. The pigment produces by this bacteria can be used to color textile.</p>

<p>To try this i first needed some material to dye, so i went to the Zeeman and bought some socks, underpants, and a shirt.</p>

<p>To make sort of a pattern i looked up different Shogun techniques and used rubber bands to tye the textile.</p>

<p>Secondly i placed the textile in a plastic bag and poured some base over the textile to feed the bacteria. We closed the bag and sterilized it by using a pressure-cooker. We want to kill most of the bacteria so our Janthino can thrive.</p>

<p>Lastly we inoculated the sterilized bag with the bacteria, sealed the bag with a cotton (to allow some oxygen to flow) and placed the bag in an incubator.</p>

<p>And now we wait.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>We checked every couple of days to see if the textile was turning blue. After waiting 12 days we didnâ€™t see any progress.</p>

<p>This was the underwear i dyed. The print is nice but not as bright as i hoped. Next time iâ€™d add more base to feed the bacteria.</p>
