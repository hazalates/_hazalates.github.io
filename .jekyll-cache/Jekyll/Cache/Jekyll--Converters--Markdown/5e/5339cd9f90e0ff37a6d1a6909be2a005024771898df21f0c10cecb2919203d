<p>On the right you see a normal kombucha SCOBY, but in the lighter jar on the left sits a jun tea SCOBY. I’ve never worked with a jun tea SCOBY before.</p>

<p>Jun tea is similiar to kombucha, but made with honey instead of sugar. Since honey is antibacterial, and a SCOBY is mostly celulose with yeast and bacteria, a normal SCOBY cannot handle honey. A jun SCOBY is resistant towards the antibacterial characteristics of honey and can ferment honey-based tea. I loosely followed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/">this</a> recipe for both jun and kombucha.</p>

<h5 id="ingredients">INGREDIENTS</h5>

<h6 id="jun">Jun:</h6>

<p>3L water</p>

<p>1L starter</p>

<p>15g Gunpowder green tea</p>

<p>320g honey</p>

<h5 id="kombucha">Kombucha:</h5>

<p>5L water</p>

<p>1L starter</p>

<p>25g English Melange black tea</p>

<p>300g raw cane sugar</p>

<h5 id="steps">STEPS</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First i sterilized the jars by giving them a good rinse with soap and filling them with boiling water. When the water cooled down i emptied the jars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the tea by boiling 1/2 the water, dissolving the sugar, adding tealeaves and letting it sit for 10 minutes. For the jun i first waited until the water cooled down to 80* before adding honey and tea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After removing the tealeaves i added the other 1/2 of the water. I waited until the water cooled down to around 30*. I poured the sweetend tea into the jar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I added the SCOBY and closed the jar using paper and a rubber band.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I meassured the sugarcontent (brix) and sourness (PH) on several days. There is a big timegap because i had COVID. I Noticed the values stayed almost the same.</p>

<p>I used a plantsoil PH meter, which problably wasn’t suitable.</p>

<p>On the 10th day the Jun looked really cloudy due to the yeast.</p>

<p>On day 14 i used PH strips to meassure, which gave better results</p>
