<p>We used the Sense scanner to make a virtual 3D model of our selves. This had to be done very careful and slow, otherwise the scanner lost itâ€™s origin-point and the 3d-scanning had to be repeated.</p>

<p>After finishing the scan, i edited my hair and the beard and snotty nose the scanner gave me. To do this i used the erase and trim tool. Once finished i used solidify and exported the scan to an .obj file.</p>

<h5 id="preparing-file-for-printing">Preparing file for printing</h5>

<p>To prepare the 3D model for the 3D printer i used the PrusaSlicer software.</p>

<p>First i set up the slicer by adding the printers from the Fablab.</p>

<p>Michelle showed some different setting like how to add support of to alter the model.</p>

<p>I went along with the following settings:</p>

<p>Print settings: 0.3 mm DRAFT</p>

<p>Filament: Prusament PETG</p>

<p>Support: None</p>

<p>Infill: 20%</p>

<p>Scale: 10%</p>

<p>Michelle showed us the following steps to start the 3D printer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on printer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat for filament - if thereâ€™s already a filament loaded, unload filament first</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put in SD card (backward)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cut filament in 45 degree angle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put filament in tube</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Load filament</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait till filament comes trough nozzle (until a clean color comes out)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare print-bed (remove old filament, clean with spray)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print from SD, select file</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Close door for pet - Open for pla</p>

<p>I Used the following filament:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-04-08-3d-scanning-printing/3d03.jpg" alt="3D" /></p>

<h6 id="error">Error</h6>

<p>When i tried to print my 3D model i ran into an error after loading the filament.  I did cut the filament in a 45 degree angle and inserted it in the tube but after loading the filament no old or new filament came out of the nozzle.</p>

<p>Apparently i didnâ€™t use enough force to load the filament. After inserting it again the filament loaded as normal.</p>

<p>My 3D printed me is no beauty but is still really recognizably me :)</p>
