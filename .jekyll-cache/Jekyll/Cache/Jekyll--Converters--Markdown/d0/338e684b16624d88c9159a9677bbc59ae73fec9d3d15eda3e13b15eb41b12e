I"á<p>To gain some more experience with the lasercutter Michelle came up with the idea of making a 3D object with the lasercutter by using a slicer. Since i wasnâ€™t at Waag the day we would try this out, i did it myself the next day. I didnâ€™t want to focus too much on the design, so i searched and found <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/cat-version-3d-model-1613622">THIS</a> nice 3D model to use.</p>

<p>I loaded the model in C4D to check if i wanted to alter anything and then opened it in slicer for Fusion360.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t used Slicer for Fusion360 before, so i played around with different setting until i liked the model. Then i went to search for a nice piece of cardboard to use. I measured the cardboard and created a custom material in Slicer</p>

<p>Based on the measurements of the cardboard and the settings of the model Slicer automatically created a file for the lasercutter.</p>
